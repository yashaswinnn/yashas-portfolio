In today\\u2019s competitive job market, many candidates struggle to prepare resumes that properly highlight their skills and match job requirements. This project solves that problem by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to automate and optimize resume creation. The system allows users to enter their personal information, education details, work experience, skills, projects, certifications, and additional links through a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit. Once the user provides the required data and selects the job role they are applying for, the AI engine analyzes the input and generates professional content such as a summary, job descriptions, and skill explanations. The application uses NLP techniques to analyze job descriptions and extract important keywords. These keywords are then matched with the user\\u2019s profile to ensure the resume is optimized for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). This increases the chances of the resume being shortlisted by recruiters. The system also provides a resume feedback and scoring feature. It evaluates the resume based on relevance, clarity, technical skills, formatting, and completeness. It identifies missing components such as key technical skills (e.g., SQL, Python, ETL, Data Modeling) and suggests improvements. Real-time grammar checking and content refinement are also included. Technically, the project consists of: * Frontend: Streamlit-based user interface * Backend: Python-based processing logic * AI Engine: OpenAI API for content generation and feedback * Document Processing: Markdown to HTML conversion and PDF generation using tools like PDFKit and wkhtmltopdf * Database/Storage: For storing user inputs and generated resumes The system architecture includes presentation, application, AI processing, and data layers to ensure scalability and performance. Security measures are implemented to protect user data. The final output is a clean, professional resume that can be downloaded as a PDF. Overall, this project automates resume writing, improves quality, saves time, and significantly enhances a candidate\\u2019s chances of securing interviews.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 12,\n        columnNumber: 11\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true), id === \"retinopathy\" && /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(_Fragment, {\n      children: [/*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"h1\", {\n        children: \"Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 41,\n        columnNumber: 11\n      }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(\"p\", {\n        children: \"This interface represents a **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System** designed to analyze retinal fundus images using a hybrid deep-learning architecture that combines **DenseNet201 and ResNet50**.
